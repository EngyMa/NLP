# How our taste in pop (music) has changed over the years? 

An Analysis that involves some methods of NLP to answer the questions, on a dataset of song lyrics:

1. What is the difference in content of song lyrics between the years? 
2. Ahh...Topic modelling? (Which topics some singers tend to ALWAYS sing about?)
3. Can we guess the singer from their lyrics?
4. Can we guess the decade from the song lyrics? ;)
